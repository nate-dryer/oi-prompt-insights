## About

This tool helps users track, analyze, and improve prompts for Open Interpreter. It offers an intuitive interface for recording prompt performance and visualizing analytics.

## Why This Tool?

Minor variations in prompt wording can significantly impact token usage and code execution. For instance, two similar prompts led to vastly different outcomes:

- **Prompt A:** Simple execution, efficient token use
- **Prompt B:** Complex local code execution, 100x more tokens used

This tool aims to:

- Track prompt variations and outcomes
- Analyze prompt efficiency
- Identify effective patterns
- Develop best practices
- Enhance Open Interpreter user experience

## Features

- Record and categorize prompts
- Visualize prompt effectiveness
- Track satisfaction rates and execution times
- Compare token usage across prompts
- Interactive analytics dashboard
- Data persistence across sessions
- Efficiency Prompt Index in Leaderboard: Rank prompts based on their efficiency

## Usage

After launching the app:

- Use the sidebar to navigate
- Record new prompts
- View analytics
- Explore insights
- Compare prompt variations
